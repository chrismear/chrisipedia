[[Chrisipedia|Home]] is a repository of [[knowledge]] spewed forth directly from the brain of [Chris Tucker Mear](https://feedmechocolate.com), purposefully without reference to external sources like [[books]] and stuff.

This means it:

* consists of an undifferentiated mixture of fact and opinion;
* contains inaccuracies; and
* is entirely uncomprehensive.
