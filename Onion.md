An onion is a [[root vegetable]]. It consists of many [[fleshy]] layers, covered in a papery [[peel]].

Two common [[varieties]] are:

* ’brown’ or ‘white’ onions (brown peel with white flesh;
* red onions (reddy-purple peel and flesh).

[[Cutting]] an onion releases [[organic chemicals]] into the [[air]] that cause most [[people]] to produce [[tears]].

Onions are a common base [[ingredient]] in [[cuisines]] from many different [[countries]].
